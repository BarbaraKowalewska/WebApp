        Our Vision

        Mensageo is a platform for hospitals and elderly centers,
        who have a shortage of medical supplies and don&apos;t have a
        reliable way to communicate these needs to the people who
        can provide them. Our platform will connect individuals and
        organizations that want to make donations with the hospitals
        and elderly centers in need.

        Who are we?

        We are a group of people with diverse backgrounds seeking to contribute
        with hospitals and Elderly centers around the world to get the protective
        personal equipment they need.

        Contact us!

        If you have any questions or suggestions please send us an email to xxx@mensageo.com
        and we will get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks!
